        Hi I'm Patryce, but please call me Pat. Originally from Brooklyn, NY, but can't stand the Brooklyn Nets. As you can see, I am a Knicks fan. I never thought I would want to be in development, but here I am. I plan on ROCKIING this funky joint.

            You are probably wondering what I like to do... Well I am a cool nerd and yes I like the word nerd! I used to run track and play basketball. I enjoy chess, shooting pool, and spending time with those that are special in my life!
            <br>

            I've already said I am from NY, but my favorite teams are the NY Knicks, Dallas Cowboys, NY Yankees, Georgetown Hoyas and NY Rangers. Go Figure... I hate the Giants!
